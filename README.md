## 🚀 MLflow-Tracking
This project demonstrates the basics of MLflow tracking 📝 by training a simple Linear Regression model 📈 and logging key details such as:

✅ Model Parameters (like weights & biases)
📊 Performance Metrics (Mean Squared Error - MSE)
📁 Saved Model Artifacts for future use

## 🔥 Why this project?
This project helps you get hands-on with MLflow, a powerful tool for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment. By the end, you'll understand how to:

🔹 Track experiments effortlessly 🏷️
🔹 Compare multiple model runs 📊
🔹 Store and retrieve trained models 🎯
